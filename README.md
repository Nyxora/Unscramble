# Unscrambler
A program to take a set of English letters and create a list of words using only the letters in the set. 
Not currently optimized, suggested to limit sets to 12 letters. 
Optimizations are planned, but no schedule is set for releases.

Questions and suggestions can be sent to bond_megan@hotmail.com
